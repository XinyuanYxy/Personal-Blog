                        <blockquote cite="https://www.britannica.com/topic/The-Great-Gatsby">The book is narrated by Nick Carraway, a Yale University graduate from 
                            the Midwest who moves to New York after World War I to pursue a career in bonds. 
                            He recounts the events of the summer he spent in the East two years later, 
                            reconstructing his story through a series of flashbacks not always told in 
                            chronological order.</blockquote>

                        <h2>A little story about myself</h2>
                        <p>I love playing guitar. I started taking guitar classes when I was in grade 8. But I had to cancel the course
                            when I had finished 15 classes because the music school was about a 1-hour drive from home. 
                            Every time I had to go there all by myself, which had discouraged me a lot. But I picked up the <b>guitar</b> again as the first semester in university began. I have been learning guitar on my own ever since. 
                            I watch tutorials to learn skills, tricks and theories. 
                        </p>
                        <p>I have been reading <em><u>The Great Gatsby</u></em> recently. I really enjoy reading this book. I know I should have read it by the end of high school.
                        But it's never too late to be a book lover. </p>
